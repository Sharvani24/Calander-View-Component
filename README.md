# Calendar View Component (Starter)

This is a starter implementation of the Calendar View assignment using:
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- Storybook

## How to use

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev app:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Run Storybook:
```bash
npm run storybook
```

This starter includes the core files requested:
- CalendarView, MonthView, WeekView
- CalendarCell, EventModal
- Hooks: useCalendar, useEventManager
- Storybook stories demonstrating multiple states

The implementation is intentionally minimal but follows the assignment constraints so you can extend it.
